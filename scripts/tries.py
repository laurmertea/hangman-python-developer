# Description
# Let's make the game iterative. 
# Now it's time to make the game resemble the classic version of Hangman a bit more. 
# The player should now guess letters in the word instead of typing the entire word all at once. 
# If the player guesses a letter, it should be uncovered in the word. 
# For now, start by building the defeat condition and add 8 tries to guess a letter that appears in the word. 
# When the player runs out of attempts, the game ends.
# Later we will determine the winning conditions, but in this stage, 
# let's just see how well our player guesses the word on each attempt.
#
# Objectives
# Now your game should work as follows:
# A player has exactly 8 tries and enters letters. 
# Nothing changes if a player has more tries left but they have already guessed the word.
# If the letter doesn't appear in the word, 
# the computer takes one try away â€“ even if the user has already guessed this letter.
# If the player doesn't have any more attempts, the game should end and the program should show a losing message. 
# Otherwise, the player can continue to input letters.
# Also, the word should be selected from our list: 
# 'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript', 
# so that your program can be tested more reliably.
# Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example. 
# Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and at the end.
#
# Examples
# The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. 
# Note that it's not part of the output.
# Example 1
# H A N G M A N
# ----------
# Input a letter: > a
# -a-a------
# Input a letter: > i
# -a-a---i--
# Input a letter: > o
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# -a-a---i--
# Input a letter: > z
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# -a-a---i--
# Input a letter: > l
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# -a-a---ip-
# Input a letter: > p
# -a-a---ip-
# Input a letter: > h
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# -a-a---ip-
# Input a letter: > k
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# Thanks for playing!
# We'll see how well you did in the next stage
#
# Example 2
# H A N G M A N
# ----
# Input a letter: > j
# j---
# Input a letter: > i
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# j---
# Input a letter: > g
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# j---
# Input a letter: > o
# That letter doesn't appear in the word
# j---
# Input a letter: > a
# ja-a
# Input a letter: > v
# java
# Input a letter: > a
# java
# Input a letter: > j
# Thanks for playing!
# We'll see how well you did in the next stage
